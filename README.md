# What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

The objective of this project is to showcase the relationship between Latitute and Temperature, Humidty, Cloudiness
and Wind Speed of 500+ cities across the world to see how weather changes as one gets closer to the equator.

This analysis is based on a random selection of 500 unique cities based on latitude and longitude and performs a weather check on each
city using a series of API calls to the OpenWeatherMap website.
